Figure X. Circos-style genome visualization of [organism/sample name].
Each circular arc represents a contig of the genome. Genes and functional regions are displayed as lines along the contigs, colored by feature type:

Blue (CDS): Protein-coding genes

Green (tRNA): Transfer RNA genes

Orange (rRNA): Ribosomal RNA genes

Red (Pseudogene): Pseudogenes

Purple (BGC): Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs)

The surrounding heatmap indicates CDS density, with darker blue representing regions of higher gene density and lighter blue for lower density. The legend aids in the quick identification of feature types and functionally dense genomic regions.


Figure X. Circos-style genome map of [organism/sample].
Circular arcs represent contigs. Lines along the arcs indicate genes and functional elements, colored as follows: CDS (blue), tRNA (green), rRNA (orange), pseudogenes (red), BGCs (purple).
The outer heatmap shows CDS density, with darker shades reflecting higher gene density. Legends provide quick identification of feature types and dense genomic regions.
